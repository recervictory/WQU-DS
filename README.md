## Unit I: Scientific Computing and Python for Data Science
In Unit I, students gain a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing, Python, and the related tools data scientists use to succeed in their work. Successful completion of Unit I is a required prerequisite for enrollment in Unit II.

## Unit II: Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis
In Unit II, students develop machine learning and statistical analysis skills through hands-on practice with open-ended investigations of real-world data. Students can expect to work with authentic public data sets from organizations like the NHS, or anonymized data on credit card defaults. This unit has a heavy emphasis on creative use of the tools of data science to solve problems from multiple perspectives.
